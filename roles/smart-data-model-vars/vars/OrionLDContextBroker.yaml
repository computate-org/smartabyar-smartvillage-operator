  Orion-LD is a Context Broker and CEF building block for context data management which supports both the NGSI-LD and the NGSI-v2 APIs. 
  It is currently a fork of the original Orion Context Broker extending support to add NGSI-LD and linked data concepts. 
  Orion-LD follows the ETSI specification for NGSI-LD and has been tested to be a stable and fast NGSI-LD broker with close compliance to the version 1.3.1 of the NGSI-LD API specification.
