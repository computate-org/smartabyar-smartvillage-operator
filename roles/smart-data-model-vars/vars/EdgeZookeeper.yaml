        description: >-
          The length of a single tick, which is the basic time unit used by ZooKeeper, as measured in milliseconds. 
          It is used to regulate heartbeats, and timeouts. 
          For example, the minimum session timeout will be two ticks.

        description: >-
          When enabled, ZooKeeper auto purge feature retains the autopurge.snapRetainCount most recent snapshots and the corresponding transaction logs in the dataDir and dataLogDir respectively and deletes the rest. 
          Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 3.

        type: number
        default: 2
        description: >-
          Amount of time, in ticks (see tickTime), to allow followers to sync with ZooKeeper.
